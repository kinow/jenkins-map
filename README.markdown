Jenkins::Map
=========

This code is based in cpan-map. Actually, it is almost the same data. But 
instead of using distributions/namespaces, it uses plugins/labels.

There is no intention of releasing this code to Perl repositories, especially 
since the modification was started by a Java developer, not a Perl one.

Feel free to modify this code freely, respecting the original project's 
license.
